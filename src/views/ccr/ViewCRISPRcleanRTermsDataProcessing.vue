      Purposes and legal basis of the data processing
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Web-App allows the user to access to a Reserved Area by entering his
      username and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Reserved area has been accessed, a useful form is made available
      to the user to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        submit his job with the experiment metadata and details (clicking on the
        button “Submit New Job”);
      </li>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        identify and access his results (clicking on the button “Results”).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the user submits his job, he can optionally enter his personal
      e-mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal data are processed by HT exclusively to offer a service to the
      data subject. If the data subject does not provide the data, HT will not
      be able to open the user account and offer its services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legal basis of the processing, therefore, consists of the need to
      execute the request of the data subject, in compliance with Article 6,
      paragraph 1, letter b) of the GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provision of personal data by the data subject (authentication
      credentials) is necessary, as failure to provide it would make it
      impossible to activate the service. The provision of the e-mail by the
      user is optional.
    </p>

    <h3 class="terms__article">Nature of the data processed</h3>
    <p>HT collects the following personal data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        Authentication credentials (username and related password);
      </li>
      <li class="terms__list-item">E-mail address (which is optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      HT processes the data to provide to the data subject the authenticated
      access to the HT services.
    </p>

    <h3 class="terms__article">
      Recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data
    </h3>
    <p>
      No personal data communicated by users will be communicated to third
      parties, unless the communication is required by law or is strictly
      necessary for the fulfillment of regulatory obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without prejudice to communications made in compliance with legal
      obligations, the personal data of the data subjects may be known,
      exclusively for the purposes listed in this Information, by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        employees and collaborators of the Data Controller, as authorized
        personnel for data processing ("Authorized subjects"), acting on Data
        Controller’s behalf and instructions (for all user account data).
      </li>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        third parties appointed by the Data Controller as Data Processor for the
        processing of personal data, pursuant to art. 28 of the GDPR. Data
        Processors are only provided with the information necessary to perform
        the services requested by the Data Controller, in compliance with the
        regulatory provisions and through the adoption of all necessary measures
        to protect the personal data of the data subjects.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="terms__article">Data retention period</h3>
    <p>
      Personal data are stored for as long as the account is open. Thereafter,
      the storage is prolonged for as long as the service is live, even if data
      subjects stop using the services. This prolongation is necessary to ensure
      legal compliance and security and to facilitate internal and external
      audits it they arise.
    </p>

    <h3 class="terms__article">
      Transfer of personal data to a third country or international organization
    </h3>
    <p>Personal data will be stored and processed within the European Union.</p>
    <p>
      In the event of any processing of personal data outside the European
      Union, the same will only take place after the adoption of adequate
      guarantees, as required by national and EU legislation.
    </p>

    <h3 class="terms__article">Rights of the data subjects</h3>
    <p>
      Data subjects have the right to obtain access to their personal data and
      the correction or cancellation of such data or the limitation of the
